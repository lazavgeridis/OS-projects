## Description
This is the final project of the Operating Systems course. In this project,  I developed the app *mirr*, an app that performs dynamic monitoring on an hierarchy of files and directories. When a modification occurs, the app updates the exact copy of the monitored hierarchy located in a backup folder. For this purpose, the Linux *inotify* system call interface is used.  

The inode (index node) is a data structure in the Linux operating system that describes a file-system object such as a file or a directory. Each inode is linked to the data of one and only file and stores all the information related to that file, except its filename (i.e i-node number, last modification date, size, etc). Therefore, each file is linked to a unique i-node, but an i-node can be linked to multiple filenames. This is achieved via hard links. In general, the logical structure of the Linux filesystem can be outlined by a acyclic directed graph (or a tree).

During the initial synchronization, the directory structure of the **source** directory gets reflected on the specified **backup** directory. At the end of this step, the 2 hierarchies will be identical.  
At the second step, we initiate the monitoring of the directories under the source directory (including source). The inotify events of interest are the following:  
1. **IN_CREATE**
2. **IN_ATTRIB**
3. **IN_MODIFY**
4. **IN_CLOSE_WRITE**
5. **IN_DELETE**
6. **IN_DELETE_SELF**
7. **IN_MOVED_FROM**
8. **IN_MOVED_TO**
